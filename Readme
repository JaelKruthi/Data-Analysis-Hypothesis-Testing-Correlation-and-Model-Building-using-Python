# Business Case
The project analyzes historical flight data from New York to three major nearby airports: Dulles International Airport (IAD), Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI), and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA). 
The goal is to look at patterns with respect to flight delays, cancellations, and the factors influencing them. 
The analysis covers flight performance, weather conditions, federal holidays, and other factors such as aircraft types, airport performance, and airline reliability. 
By using this analysis, local authorities, airlines, and insurers can make more informed decisions to improve safety, reduce operational inefficiencies, and enhance customer satisfaction.
